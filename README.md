# LMS
This learning management system was a semester long project for CSCE 247: Software Engineering. For the first half of the semester, we designed profiles for potential users, design documents, requirement documents, UML diagrams, and various other preparational tools.

Then, we spent two weeks implementing our design with Java. We used JSON files to save user data along with JSON readers and writers to store and access data when necessary. We also implemented a command line UI for users to test our LMS. 

Finally, we performed JUnit testing for debugging our program and creating a comprehensive bug report. At the end of the semester, we creating a high fidelity prototype for an iPhone app with Proto.io.

This page contains the code for the entire project along with the design documents and bug reports.
